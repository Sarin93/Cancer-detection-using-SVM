In this project, I utilized SVMs to analyze cell samples for cancer detection. Leveraging the power of machine learning, we processed a dataset containing various features extracted from cell samples and trained SVM models to classify them as benign or malignant.

Here's a brief overview of what we accomplished:

🔍 Data Preprocessing: We cleaned the dataset by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values to ensure accurate analysis.

📊 Model Training: We split the data into training and testing sets, then trained two SVM models with different kernels: linear and radial basis function (RBF).

📈 Evaluation: We evaluated the performance of both models using metrics such as accuracy score, R2 score, and confusion matrix to assess their effectiveness in cancer detection.
